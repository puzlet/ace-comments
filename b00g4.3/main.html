==$\LaTeX$/MathJax and hyperlinks in Ace editor code comments==
[/ Puzlet] is about scientific computing in the browser.
For scientific computing code, 
it's useful to include math and hyperlinks in code comments, as [/m/b00c4 this example] shows.
(Also, see [/m/b007h, this example] for similar Octave/Python code.)

The CoffeeScript code below shows how to do this.  To see the generated JavaScript (below the CoffeeScript), 
click the "JS" toggle button (top right).

Click in the CoffeeScript editor to edit the math/link source.  Click outside of the editor to see the rendered math/links.

This math/link rendering feature is now standard in Puzlet blabs.
You can also create a hyperlink for any identifier (e.g., variable, function call).
This is particularly useful for links to functions defined in other blabs.
